	abstract = {Do your students lack confidence in their ability to handle quantitative work? Are they unsure about how best to use SAS, SPSS, and Excel programs? The new edition of the bestselling textbook Statistics for the Social Sciences is the solution. The previous editions of this book were popular with instructors because they helped build students' confidence and ability in doing statistical analysis, by slowly moving from concepts that require little computational work to those that require more. In this new edition, author R. Mark Sirkin demonstrates how statistics can be used so that the students come to appreciate their usefulness rather than fearing them.Key Features of the Third Edition:''- An emphasis on the analysis and interpretation of data giving students a feel for how data interpretation is related to the methods by which the data was obtained- A wide range of examples from various fields in the social sciences demonstrate the role of statistical analysis in the research process- Coverage of the scientific method and how each statistical technique relates to the larger field of research - Emphasis on the interpretation of tables helping students master a topic that often proves challenging- Plenty of exercises are provided at the end of chapters so that students can practise all the statistical procedures covered- Answers to selected questions appear at the end of the book with complete worked-out solutions- Additional exercises have been added to reflect the additional computer coverage- User-friendly ways of navigating the text - key concepts are introduced and highlighted within the text, with definitions provided in boxes at the foot of each page- A handy glossary of all the the key concepts and terms in provided at the back of the book as an aid to revision- New tools to teach students how to do analysis not only through SAS and SPSS, but also using Excel descriptive statistics featuresThis book will be invaluable for upper level undergraduate students and graduate students across the social sciences. An Instructor's CD-ROM containing data sets, Powerpoint slides, exercises and answers will be available free-of-charge to professors adopting this text.},

	abstract = {An insightful, revealing history of the magical mathematics that transformed our world. At a summer tea party in Cambridge, England, a guest states that tea poured into milk tastes different from milk poured into tea. Her notion is shouted down by the scientific minds of the group. But one man, Ronald Fisher, proposes to scientifically test the hypothesis. There is no better person to conduct such an experiment, for Fisher is a pioneer in the field of statistics. The Lady Tasting Tea spotlights not only Fisher's theories but also the revolutionary ideas of dozens of men and women which affect our modern everyday lives. Writing with verve and wit, David Salsburg traces breakthroughs ranging from the rise and fall of Karl Pearson's theories to the methods of quality control that rebuilt postwar Japan's economy, including a pivotal early study on the capacity of a small beer cask at the Guinness brewing factory. Brimming with intriguing tidbits and colorful characters, The Lady Tasting Tea salutes the spirit of those who dared to look at the world in a new way.},

	title = {Econometric {Analysis} of {Cross} {Section} and {Panel} {Data}},
	isbn = {978-0-262-23258-6},
	abstract = {The second edition of this acclaimed graduate text provides a unified treatment of two methods used in contemporary econometric research, cross section and data panel methods. By focusing on assumptions that can be given behavioral content, the book maintains an appropriate level of rigor while emphasizing intuitive thinking. The analysis covers both linear and nonlinear models, including models with dynamics and/or individual heterogeneity. In addition to general estimation frameworks (particular methods of moments and maximum likelihood), specific linear and nonlinear methods are covered in detail, including probit and logit models and their multivariate, Tobit models, models for count data, censored and missing data schemes, causal (or treatment) effects, and duration analysis.Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data was the first graduate econometrics text to focus on microeconomic data structures, allowing assumptions to be separated into population and sampling assumptions. This second edition has been substantially updated and revised. Improvements include a broader class of models for missing data problems; more detailed treatment of cluster problems, an important topic for empirical researchers; expanded discussion of "generalized instrumental variables" (GIV) estimation; new coverage (based on the author's own recent research) of inverse probability weighting; a more complete framework for estimating treatment effects with panel data, and a firmly established link between econometric approaches to nonlinear panel data and the "generalized estimating equation" literature popular in statistics and other fields. New attention is given to explaining when particular econometric methods can be applied; the goal is not only to tell readers what does work, but why certain "obvious" procedures do not. The numerous included exercises, both theoretical and computer-based, allow the reader to extend methods covered in the text and discover new insights.},

	abstract = {In this 3rd edition revised text, master expositor Sheldon Ross has produced a unique work in introductory statistics. The text's main merits are the clarity of presentation, contemporary examples and applications from diverse areas, and an explanation of intuition and ideas behind the statistical methods. Concepts are motivated, illustrated and explained in a way that attempts to increase one's intuition. To quote from the preface, "It is only when a student develops a feel or intuition for statistics that she or he is really on the path toward making sense of data."  Ross achieves this goal through a coherent mix of mathematical analysis, intuitive discussions and examples.  Applications and examples refer to real-world issues, such as gun control, stock price models, health issues, driving age limits, school admission ages, use of helmets, sports, scientific fraud and many others.

Available textbooks are written for mathematics or economics majors, and fail to convey to students of political science and sociology the reasons for learning often-abstract mathematical concepts. A Mathematics Course for Political and Social Research fills this gap, providing both a primer for math novices in the social sciences and a handy reference for seasoned researchers. The book begins with the fundamental building blocks of mathematics and basic algebra, then goes on to cover essential subjects such as calculus in one and more than one variable, including optimization, constrained optimization, and implicit functions; linear algebra, including Markov chains and eigenvectors; and probability. It describes the intermediate steps most other textbooks leave out, features numerous exercises throughout, and grounds all concepts by illustrating their use and importance in political science and sociology.

	abstract = {"A Gentle Introduction to Stata, Second Edition is aimed at new Stata users who want to become proficient in Stata. After reading this introductory text, new users will not only be able to use Stata well but also learn new aspects of Stata easily. Acock assumes that the user is not familiar with any statistical software. This assumption of a blank slate is central to the structure and contents of the book. Acock starts with the basics; for example, the portion of the book that deals with data management begins with a careful and detailed example of turning survey data on paper into a Stata-ready dataset on the computer. When explaining how to go about basic exploratory statistical procedures, Acock includes notes that should help the reader develop good work habits. This mixture of explaining good Stata habits and good statistical habits continues throughout the book. Acock is quite careful to teach the reader all aspects of using Stata. He covers data management, good work habits (including the use of basic do-files), basic exploratory statistics (including graphical displays), and analyses using the standard array of basic statistical tools (correlation, linear and logistic regression, and parametric and nonparametric tests of location and dispersion). Acock teaches Stata commands by using the menus and dialog boxes while still stressing the value of do-files. In this way, he ensures that all types of users can build good work habits. Each chapter has exercises that the motivated reader can use to reinforce the material. The tone of the book is friendly and conversational without ever being glib or condescending. Important asides and notes about terminology are set off in boxes, which makes the text easy to read without any convoluted twists or forward-referencing. Rather than splitting topics by their Stata implementation, Acock chose to arrange the topics as they would be in a basic statistics textbook; graphics and postestimation are woven into the material in a natural fashion. Real datasets, such as the General Social Surveys from 2002 and 2006, are used throughout the book. The focus of the book is especially helpful for those in psychology and the social sciences, because the presentation of basic statistical modeling is supplemented with discussions of effect sizes and standardized coefficients. Various selection criteria, such as semipartial correlations, are discussed for model selection. The second edition of the book has been updated to reflect new features in Stata 10 and includes a new chapter on the use of factor analysis to develop valid, reliable scale measures."--Publisher's website.},
